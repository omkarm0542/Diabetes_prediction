# Diabetes_prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. 
The project is built using Python and various libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on Kaggle. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, which indicates whether a patient has diabetes or not. The variables include information such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.

## Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

> pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
> cd diabetes-prediction
3. Install the dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

> jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and make predictions.
